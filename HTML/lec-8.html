        Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of
        flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost)<br>
        Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived
        danger.<br>
        A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.<br>
        [33] However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck
        loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks.<br>
        Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the
        ground.[34]

        Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from neighbouring
        nests into their own. The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations,
        rather than having a different nest for every bird. Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same
        location. It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time.
        If the nest is small,
        or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other.
        There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.[39]
