    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from
        Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a
        cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually
        immature female is called a pullet.</p>

    <h2>Behavior</h2>

    <h3>Social behaviour</h3>

    <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of
        eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking order",
        with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from
        a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding
        hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[32]</p>


    <h3>Crowing</h3>

    <p>Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow as
        well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.[35]</p>



    <h3>Rooster crowing contests</h3>

    <p>Rooster crowing contests, also known as crowing contests, are a traditional sport in several countries, such as
        Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,[36] the United States, Indonesia and Japan. The oldest contests are held with
        longcrowers. Depending on the breed, either the duration of the crowing or the times the rooster crows within a
        certain time is measured.</p>


    <h3>Courtship</h3>

    <p>To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen ("a circle dance"), often lowering
        the wing which is closest to the hen.[37] The dance triggers a response in the hen[37] and when she responds to
        his "call", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.</p>
