            <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl
                originally
                from
                Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a
                cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually
                immature female is called a pullet.</p>

                Courtship
            </h2>
            <p>
                To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen ("a circle dance"), often
                lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[37] The dance triggers a response in the hen[37] and when
                she responds to his "call", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.
            </p>

            <p>More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Male approaching the hen</li>
                <li>Male pre-copulatory waltzing</li>
                <li>Male waltzing</li>
                <li>Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away (if unwilling to copulate)
                </li>
                <li>Male mounting</li>
                <li>Male treading with both feet on hen's back</li>
                <li>Male tail bending (following successful copulation)[38]</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>

        <section>
            <h3>Social behaviour</h3>

            <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the
                incubation of
                eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking
                order",
                with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or
                roosters
                from
                a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established.
                Adding
                hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[32]</p>

            <h3>Crowing</h3>

            <p>Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow
                as
                well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.[35]

            <h3>Rooster crowing contests</h3>

            <p>Rooster crowing contests, also known as crowing contests, are a traditional sport in several countries,
                such
                as
                Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,[36] the United States, Indonesia and Japan. The oldest contests are
                held
                with
                longcrowers. Depending on the breed, either the duration of the crowing or the times the rooster crows
                within a
                certain time is measured.</p>
